# Digital Menu System 🍽️  

A **high school computer science project** developed using **Python** and **MySQL**, designed to simplify restaurant and café operations.  

This project was created as part of my **Class 12 Computer Science final practicals**, where I applied programming concepts to solve a real-world problem. It integrates customers, chefs, and admins into one system for efficient digital menu management.

👨‍💻 About the Project
This project was developed during my high school (Class 12) as part of the CBSE Computer Science curriculum. It gave me hands-on experience in:

Writing modular Python code

Database integration with MySQL

Problem-solving through real-world use cases

🚀 Future Enhancements
Add a GUI interface

Online order tracking system

User authentication with password hashing

🙌 Acknowledgement
Special thanks to my teachers and school for guidance during this project.

Do you also want me to make a **smaller `README.md` version** (just features + setup) for the `/docs` folder, so your main repo stays clean?
